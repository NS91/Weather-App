# FreeCodeCamp Weather App.

Built for one of FCC's intermediate bonfire challenges.

Project was extremely helpful in understanding how to request and display information from APIs as well as how to use API's in conjunction with one another, in this case to take the users IP and then use that to find their local weather.

Built with the OpenWeatherMap and IP-API APIs.
